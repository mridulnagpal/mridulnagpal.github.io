                        I am a resident of Delhi currently Studying in IIIT Hyderabad. Life has been nice to me till now :P . I believe in not being Jack of All Trades but being the King of All Trades. I have been given a lot of responsibilities since my childhood. I was a part of an Organisation which used to organise events and manage them which gave me a lot of social exploitation and knowledge. I was the Head Boy of my School as well as the head of our School's Council which gave me plenty of invaluable experience.<br><br>


                        I was a Jock as well in school, I used to play Basketball, Football, Table Tennis, etc. for my school. We even reached Zonal level for Football. Currently I am learning about Web Development, Open Source and Artificial Intelligence. I am an eager learner and am on a quest for knowledge. I am always up for a challenge. I find Coding as a puzzle, which I am really curious to solve.<br><br>


                        I would love to Intern for companies concerning Web Development and learn more about it. I am willing to work as hard as I can to accomplish my goals. I am currently living in hostel where I have access to almost any of the possible resources and have only one goal to achieve. I am kind of a stubborn kid when it comes to challenges.<br><br>


                        I believe in self confidence and determination as these two things can get you almost everything. I am always looking for new experiences and new heights to conquer. Recently I completed hacktoberfest challenge regarding Open Source and was honored with a T-Shirt regarding the same. I am currently active on several competitive coding websites such as hackerrank.com, codechef.com, codeforces.com, etc. I am an extroveert by nature but when it comes to work I need to be alone. I have had some leadership oppurtunities as well in school. I was able to manage my team and we made it to
