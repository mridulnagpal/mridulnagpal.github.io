                        I am a Delhite currently Studying in IIIT Hyderabad. I believe in not being Jack of All Trades but being the King of all. I have been given a lot of responsibilities since my childhood. I was a shy and introvert till I was in 10th standard, but a series of events got me out of it all. I was a part of the student council which dealt with the management of school level events. I was appointed as the head, i.e the Head Boy, of the School Council which gave me plenty of invaluable experience.<br><br>


                        I was sort of a Jock as well in school, I used to play Basketball, Football, Table Tennis, etc. for my school. We were able to win some trophies for our school as well. Currently I am the CTO for my startup named Abatar. I am not much of a reader but love philosophy. I sure am a melomaniac and a bagpacker. I love to go on treks and solo trips. I am a Green Panther and would never miss an oppurtunity to go for a trip with a stunning view.<br><br>


                        Regarding my interests in tech, I love machine learning and am a bit experienced in it as well. I would love to build a human robot one day, solving the turing test.<br><br>


                        I am good with teamwork and management, currently I hold the head of Corporate Relations team of IIIT Hyderabad's Entrpreneurship Cell. Also I am an admin for the Open Source Development Group of IIIT.

                <p>
                    This project is an extension of last year's GSoC project. In this summer I have added various new functionalities to the existing leaflet-blurred-location library and created another library to display locations saved by leaflet-blurred-location in a tricky way so that no information is leaked without the user's permission. This project involved refactoring of the existing code and adding CodeClimate to the repository as well. New UI tools were also added to leaflet-blurred-location along with resolving some previous bugs as well.
                    <br>
                    For leaflet-blurred-location-display, almost the whole repository was set up and integrated with leaflet-blurred-location to provide a demo. The demo for leaflet-blurred-location-display is live with all the features of leaflet-blurred-location as well.

                    There are a plethora of works focusing on detection and classification of online hate. Yet, few studies aim at developing metrics for decision makers to better understand online hate in their social media content.
                    <br>
                    This research undertakes that challenge and introduces provocation score, a measure for hatefulness of online videos, based on the number and intensity of hateful comments a video receives. Easily understandable metrics and visualizations of the prevalence of hate in different content pieces is crucial for community moderators and content creators when they evaluate how provocative their content is, and plan their production activities.

It helps users to make a better social profile with lesser maintainance and hard work. You could get your social profile on all social platforms, and you will be updated/suggested of the things that are going on and what should you be posting. It will predict the number of likes and comments you would receive based on your posts.<br /> 
                    We use machine learning to predict all this based on your history. Later versions include posting on your behalf, recommending people to follow, how to increase followers, etc. You can learn more about it <a href="https://abatar.me/">here</a>

                    Creating pictures of faces using Generative models. Working with various conditions such as ethnicity, age, gender to generate faces using stack GANs after preprocessing for Automated Persona Generation. I am using multiple layers in the stack, each layer consisting of generators and discriminators of different dimensions. This idea was taken up by the NVIDIA paper on high resolution face generation, but now we have to do it with conditions on faces.<br /> 
                    We focus on feeding face structure, complexion and age as the input features and would get a new face in return. Later stages include Automated Persona Generation where one can build a whole new person profile online using only some input features.

                    LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback.<br />

                    It also makes it possible to incorporate both item and user metadata into the traditional matrix factorization algorithms. It represents each user and item as the sum of the latent representations of their features, thus allowing recommendations to generalise to new items (via item features) and to new users (via user features).<br />

                    Surprise provides various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson…) are built-in.<br />
